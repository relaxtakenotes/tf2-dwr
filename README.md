 Dynamic Weapon Reverb for TF2 in VScript

Did you know I like doing random shit? Well now you know, as it is the result of that.

Yep, this is DWRV3 in VScript. Chance is that you can run it on any VScript compatible source engine game, but it's originally meant for TF2.

It's more of a meme than a serious mod, because VScript is really limited. For example in this version explosion reverb is not present, because there's (seemingly) no way to detect explosions.

You can run this on any map locally by running "script_execute dwr".

Since there's a buncha expensive calculations you'll have a console full of warnings such as this: "SCRIPT PERF WARNING --- 'CheckWeaponFire' ran long at 4.318995ms". Deal with it :tm:
